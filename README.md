- 👋 Hi, I’m @oernster.  I have 27+ years of IT experience.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything Python and I do a lot of gaming; especially with a HOTAS setup.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and when I get round to it maybe some Golang.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my public repos if you have something constructive to contribute.
Alternatively, if you have Virpil HOTAS gear and want some assistance on your own project I'd be happy to help.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me as Oliver Ernster on www.linkedin.com or as Rodent[insert-hash-here]0042 on Discord if you need to.
