- Hi, I’m Oliver (@oernster) — Lead/Principal engineer (BSc Hons Physics) with 28+ years in Python, automation, and tooling.
- I’m interested in anything Python and I love 3D printing.
- I’m currently learning more about React and when I get round to it maybe some Golang/Rust.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any of my public repos if you have something constructive to contribute.
- Contact: Discord oliver5000 (or message me here on GitHub).
