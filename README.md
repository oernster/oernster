- 👋 Hi, I’m @oernster (Oliver Ernster aka Cmdr ASmallFurryRodent when gaming)
GamerTag history:
Back in 1984, there was a game called Elite; it was the first 3D graphic game EVER and used wireframes and was on the BBC model B 32k computer.  It was a space game where you fly a cobra mk III spacecraft and have fun.  Now, in this game, since they had majorly limited memory space on the computer (32k), they used procedurally generated code to create the planet names and alien names etc for each of the star systems.  So, the aliens had names like Giant Green Slimy Toads and Black Small Furry Rodents.  I stole my gamer tag from this (I play the latest variant of Elite called Elite: Dangerous that I backed on Kickstarter and get all DLC forever into the future and have a full HOTAS setup with rudder pedals for it and control panels).  My gamer tag is ASmallFurryRodent and on discord it's Rodent.  FWIW, I’m not a furry in the odd sense (each to their own though), just in the gamer sense.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything Python and I do a lot of gaming; especially with a HOTAS setup.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and when I get round to it maybe some Golang.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my public repos if you have something constructive to contribute.
Alternatively, if you have Virpil HOTAS gear and want some assistance on your own project I'd be happy to help.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me as Oliver Ernster on www.linkedin.com or as Rodent[insert-hash-here]0042 on Discord if you need to.
